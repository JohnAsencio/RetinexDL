# RetinexDL: Low-Light Image Enhancement Using Retinex Theory and Deep Learning

This notebook demonstrates how to build a deep learning model using Keras and convolutional layers to enhance low-light images. The model applies principles from Retinex theory, which helps improve image visibility by simulating how humans perceive light and color in scenes with poor illumination.

Key steps include:
* Generating low-light images by applying Poisson noise to simulate low-light conditions.
* Building a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to enhance these darkened images.
* Evaluating the model's performance using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and visualizing the enhancements.

The model demonstrates up to an 85% improvement in image quality, making it a practical solution for low-light image enhancement tasks. Please refer to the research paper for precise measures taken and for more information on how the model works.
